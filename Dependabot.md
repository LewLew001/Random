Yes, Azure DevOps Git **does** offer functionality similar to GitHub's **Dependabot alerts**, but it's a bit more nuanced.

### üõ°Ô∏è Dependabot in Azure DevOps
Microsoft has integrated **Dependabot security updates** into **GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps**, which means:

- You can **automatically create pull requests** to fix vulnerable dependencies.
- It works with **Azure Repos**, not just GitHub-hosted repos.
- It links pull requests to **dependency scanning alerts**, helping you track and resolve issues efficiently.

### üîß How to Enable It
There are **two main ways** to get Dependabot-style functionality in Azure DevOps:

1. **GitHub Advanced Security for Azure DevOps**  
   - This is the official route.
   - Requires enabling GitHub Advanced Security features in your Azure DevOps organization.
   - More info on [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/release-notes/roadmap/2024/ghazdo/dependabot).

2. **Community Extension: Dependabot for Azure DevOps**  
   - Developed by Tingle Software, not officially affiliated with Microsoft.
   - Lets you run Dependabot tasks inside your Azure Pipelines.
   - Requires a `.azuredevops/dependabot.yml` config file and pipeline setup.
   - You can explore it on [GitHub](https://github.com/mburumaxwell/dependabot-azure-devops).

So yes, Azure DevOps Git can absolutely help you stay on top of dependency vulnerabilities‚Äîjust with a slightly different setup than GitHub.
